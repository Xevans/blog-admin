Effectively creating a CMS

Create a page that allows you to build a blog top down

Title field
summary field
featured_media
featured_media_caption
featured_media_attr
heading 1
paragraph 1
paragraph 2
media_link 1
caption 1
heading 2
media_link 2
caption 2
paragraph 3

you can pless a button and select what element you would like to add
ex: if you select paragraph, you will get a text box you can write in

ex2: if you select media, you will have 3 req fields. media link, caption, attribution

(future idea: work in a split window where output blogg shows in left screen)


Main Tasks:
- Setup firebase auth in conn module (follow docs). (done)
- create context to store auth. (done)
- test getAuth (done)
- Create a test form to send the doc with auth.

if all works at the stage, proceed to create the ui elements mentioned above.

- Like above, want to be able to create form fields
    - On 'submit', want to generate the blog as html using the field data
    - Then show a preview below the form (can do something fancy like a split view later)
    - if everything looks okay, you can click an upload button which will... 
        - prompt category selection details
        - when completed, you can click a confirm button to finalize the upload.


Main Tasks:

Create dynamic form.

Each "Section" is an object

A section contains a:
    - heading
    - paragraph
    - Media link
    - Media caption
    - Media attribution
where each field is optional.

I will have the ability to add more objects to the array
where each object's prperty will corespond to the field for that section
