featured_media_caption
featured_media_attr
heading 1
paragraph 1
paragraph 2
media_link 1
caption 1
heading 2
media_link 2
caption 2
paragraph 3

you can pless a button and select what element you would like to add
ex: if you select paragraph, you will get a text box you can write in

ex2: if you select media, you will have 3 req fields. media link, caption, attribution

(future idea: work in a split window where output blogg shows in left screen)
